# Larabrix

**Larabrix** is a modular Laravel starter kit based on tabler-1.3.0 that helps you skip the boring parts of web development. It gives you ready-made building blocks — like product management, media uploads, menus, and task boards — so you can focus on building your app instead of repeating the same setup over and over.

> ⚠️ Larabrix is currently under development. Modules will be released incrementally.
